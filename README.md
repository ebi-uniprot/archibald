# UniProt style guide

This is the living style guide for the UniProt website. It is based on [Foundation for Sites 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites).

## Installation

To use this, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.10 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)

### Running the style guide

The following command runs the server:

```bash
gulp serve
```

It uses [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) so you can access it from multiple devices at once. The SASS files is recompiled automatically and BrowserSync handles the browser reload.


### Building the style guide
TBD
